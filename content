Make a cool other webpage
Close the index.html file, and create another one, called tweets.html. You can either create it from scratch (and therefore, you will have to re-type all of the <html>, <head>, <body> tags, etc. that ought to be in all webpages), or you can create it by copying it from index.html, as you've previously learned to do, and replacing what you need to replace.

To see the webpage in your browser, you can access this URL: http://3.235.76.24/tweets.html. Note that the name of the tweets.html file should always be at the end of the URL like that, so that the browser knows which HTML file to render; index.html is an exception.

This page may contain anything you want, but it must:

embed at least one tweet;
contain a link to your index.html webpage, for users who may go back to your homepage; and your index.html should also contain a link to tweets.html, for users landing on your homepage, who want to see your tweets!
Here's the official documentation from Twitter about embedding single tweets in a webpage's HTML code.

Make a cool website
Decide on at least two other webpages and their content, that you could add to your website, and then create them as HTML files.

However, in order to start getting consistency throughout the website, all of the HTML files (including index.html and tweets.html) must now have the same structure:

The <body> tag of all of your webpages (including index.html and tweets.html) must contain exactly three direct sub-tags in that order: <header>, <main> and <footer>.
The <header> tag must contain an unordered list (the <ul> and <li> tags) of links (the <a> tag) to each of your webpages. As you may have understood, this will serve as a navigation for your website.
The <footer> tag must contain one paragraph with the sentence Made by Victor Adieri for <a href="https://alx-apply.hbtn.io" target="_blank">ALX</a>.
The <main> tag must contain two direct sub-tags in that order: <article> and <aside>.
<article> contains the content of your webpage: texts, links, images, tweets, â€¦ This is the part of index.html and tweets.html that you have already written, and you must now write it as you like for the other pages.
<aside> contains a single paragraph, just reading for now "placeholder to add comment thread later".
